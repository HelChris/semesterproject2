# Semester Project 2 - Auction Website

## Project Description

This project is part of my delivery for the Front-End Development studies at Noroff. The goal is to build a fully functional auction website using all the skills we've learnd throughout the studies.

The website allows visitor to register users, users to create auctions, bid on others' listings, and manage their own profile. The application is built with a modular file structure, semantic HTML for proper base structure, tailwind CSS for styling + responsive layout and javascript to handle interaction and functionality.

## Goal

> Build a modern auction website where users can buy and sell items through a credit-based bidding system.
